publisher: IEEE
abstract: An optimized formation controller for multiple quadrotors is proposed in this paper. The formation control is implemented using a hybrid approach which combines the Virtual Structure and Artificial Potential Field approaches. The Artificial Potential Field technique is applied for path planning optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method, while the Virtual Structure is used to keep the formation in place. In addition, for controlling the altitude and attitude of the quadrotor, an optimized PID type controller based on PSO is also implemented in the overall control structure. The proposed control strategies for formation control of multiple quadrotors are demonstrated through simulation studies. The results show that the quadrotors can effectively keep the formation and   choose the short path to the target point without collision.
