1. improve performance by 3x times 
S: A UI component used by many features are very slow 

T: I created a new component with better implementation with
fast algorithm by better technique,
using appropriate data structure, 
generics, 
unit test, 
modular structure

R: As a result, the UI component has better performance (about 3 times faster), 
easier to read, 
easier to maintable, 
very extendsible and flexible,
more robust.
When the new requirements come from business, 
The team build the features faster because the extendsibility of the component.
The user is happier due to faster performance.
